EasyA x Vechain Hackathon - Sustainability track

Offers online shoppers a plug in (currently compatible with eBay but will soon include other retailers once we gain access to their API) to reward sustainable shopping behaviours via B3TR tokens, this is currently demonstrated using a custom token that we minted, Fixify, since B3TR testnet tokens are going to be launched on the main net so we were unable to claim testnet tokens. This helps to incentivise sustainable shopping within VeChain's VeBetterDAO community that supports sustainable behaviours.
